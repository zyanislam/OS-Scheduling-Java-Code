# OS-Scheduling-Java-Code

This repository contains FCFS, SJF & SRJF codes written in Java. 

## Hope this helps out all the students who are learning Operating Systems
I, myself as a undergraduate student had a hard time making the code work, so I want make it a little bit easier for others to find the guidelines to write their Scheduling Codes. 

## It's actually fun!!
Trust me, as much as it's a pain to writing fully working codes, it's definitly worth it in the end when it all works out and you can be proud of all the time you had given towards this. As a CSE student, I loved it when it was complete. Those long sleepless hours didn't feel like it was a total waste.

# So cheer up and practise, learn and make it work out.
